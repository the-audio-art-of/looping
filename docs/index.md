<h1>Welcome to The Art of Looping!</h1>

In this website I share my personal research about how samples were looped in the 80s and 90s,
with accessible current tools!
</div>

## Why?

I was very interested about old sample libraries and synthesizers, which made me research a lot about it.
Also, I was very interested on developing sample libraries, so I had to learn about sample rate,
fine tune, and of course, looping. During the next years, I tried to decipher the way big companies
such as Roland, Yamaha, Korg and more, created loops, because I was impressed of how they get
a really good result with little memory, and some of them I can't replicate even with the most precise
and perfect crossfade I could make. I discover things during this research and practice them.
Now I'm gonna share with you what I learned. Since today's world, memory is not a limit anymore
and people forget about other looping techniques besides of crossfade.
